## Why Stagent

AI agents are powerful but running them unsupervised is risky. Stagent gives you a dashboard to create tasks, dispatch them to Claude agents, watch execution in real time, and respond when agents need human judgment — bridging the gap between autonomous AI and human oversight.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone <repo-url> && cd stagent && npm install

# Set up your Anthropic API key
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here" > .env.local

# Start the dev server
npm run dev
```

Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to get started.

```

**Key design decisions:**

- **Server Components for reads** — Pages query SQLite directly, no API layer for reads
- **Fire-and-forget execution** — `POST /api/tasks/{id}/execute` returns 202, agent runs async
- **Notification-as-queue** — The `notifications` table is the message bus for human-in-the-loop; agents poll it via `canUseTool`
- **SSE for streaming** — `/api/logs/stream` pushes agent logs to the browser in real time
- **Profile-based routing** — Agent profiles define system prompts, allowed tools, and MCP configs per task type
- **Permission pre-check** — Saved "Always Allow" patterns bypass the notification loop for trusted tools

## Feature Deep Dives

### Core

#### Task Board
Kanban-style board with five columns: Planned → Queued → Running → Completed → Failed. Drag tasks between valid states, create inline, filter by project, and click any card for a detail panel with execution history.

#### Project Management
Create and organize projects as containers for related tasks. Each project can specify a working directory — agent tasks resolve `cwd` from the project's path, enabling agents to operate on external codebases. Server-rendered project cards with task counts, status badges, and a detail view at `/projects/[id]`.

#### Homepage Dashboard
Five-zone landing page: time-of-day greeting with live DB stats, priority task queue, activity feed, quick actions grid, and recent projects with progress bars. Includes sparkline charts, mini bar charts, and donut rings for at-a-glance trend visualization.

### Agent

#### Agent Integration
Claude Agent SDK integration with the `canUseTool` polling pattern. Tasks are dispatched fire-and-forget and run asynchronously. Every tool call, reasoning step, and decision is logged to `agent_logs`.

#### Multi-Agent Routing
Profile-based agent routing with four starter profiles: General, Code Reviewer, Researcher, and Document Writer. Each profile defines a system prompt, allowed tools, and MCP server configuration. A task classifier auto-selects the best profile based on task content, and users can override. Workflow steps support per-step profile assignment.

#### Workflow Engine
Multi-step task orchestration with three patterns:
- **Sequence** — Steps execute in order
- **Planner→Executor** — One agent plans, another executes each step
- **Human-in-the-Loop Checkpoint** — Pauses for human approval between steps

State machine engine with step-level retry, project association, and real-time status visualization.

#### AI Task Assist
AI-powered task creation: generate improved descriptions, break tasks into sub-tasks, recommend workflow patterns, and estimate complexity — all via the Agent SDK's `query` function.

#### Session Management
Resume failed or cancelled agent tasks with one click. Tracks retry counts (limit: 3), detects expired sessions, and provides atomic claim to prevent duplicate runs.

#### Autonomous Loop Execution *(in progress)*
Ralph Wiggum-inspired iterative agent loop pattern. Agents can loop through tasks with configurable stop conditions, iteration tracking, and convergence detection.

### Documents

#### Document Management
Full document browser at `/documents` with table and grid views. Upload files with drag-and-drop, preview images/PDFs/markdown/code inline, search by filename and extracted text, and filter by processing status or project. Bulk delete, link/unlink to projects and tasks.

#### Document Preprocessing
Automatic text extraction on upload for five file types: text, PDF (pdf-parse), images (image-size), Office documents (mammoth/jszip), and spreadsheets (xlsx). Extracted text, processed paths, and processing errors are tracked per document.

#### Agent Document Context
Documents linked to a task are automatically injected into the agent's prompt as context. The context builder aggregates extracted text from all linked documents, giving agents access to uploaded reference material without manual copy-paste.

### Platform

#### Tool Permission Persistence
"Always Allow" option for agent tool permissions. When you approve a tool, you can save it as a pattern (e.g., `Bash(command:git *)`, `Read`, `mcp__server__tool`). Saved patterns are checked before creating notifications — trusted tools are auto-approved instantly. Manage patterns from the Settings page. `AskUserQuestion` always requires human input.

#### Scheduled Prompt Loops *(in progress)*
Time-based scheduling for agent tasks with human-friendly intervals (`5m`, `2h`, `1d`) and raw 5-field cron expressions. One-shot and recurring modes with pause/resume lifecycle, expiry limits, and max firings. Each firing creates a child task through the existing execution pipeline. Scheduler runs as a poll-based engine started via Next.js instrumentation hook.

#### Micro-Visualizations
Pure SVG chart primitives (Sparkline, MiniBar, DonutRing) with zero charting dependencies. Integrated into: homepage stats cards (7-day trends), activity feed (24h bar chart), project cards (completion donuts), monitor overview (success rate), and project detail (stacked status + 14-day sparkline). Full accessibility with `role="img"` and `aria-label`.

### UI & DevEx

#### Inbox & Human-in-the-Loop
When an agent needs approval or input, a notification appears in your inbox. Review tool permission requests with "Allow Once" / "Always Allow" / "Deny" buttons, answer agent questions, and see task completion summaries. Supports bulk dismiss and 10s polling.

#### Monitoring
Real-time agent log streaming via Server-Sent Events. Filter by task or event type, click entries to jump to task details, and auto-pause polling when the tab is hidden (Page Visibility API).

#### Content Handling
File upload with drag-and-drop in task creation. Type-aware content preview for text, markdown (via react-markdown), code, and JSON. Copy-to-clipboard and download-as-file for task outputs.

#### Settings
Configuration hub with three sections: authentication (API key or OAuth), tool permissions (saved "Always Allow" patterns with revoke), and data management.

#### CLI
`npx stagent` launches the dev server and opens the dashboard. Built with Commander, compiled via tsup to `dist/cli.js`.

#### Database
SQLite with WAL mode via better-sqlite3 + Drizzle ORM. Eight tables: `projects`, `tasks`, `workflows`, `agent_logs`, `notifications`, `documents`, `schedules`, `settings`. Self-healing bootstrap — tables are created on startup if missing.

#### App Shell
Responsive sidebar with collapsible navigation, dark/light/system theme, and OKLCH hue 250 blue-indigo color palette. Built on shadcn/ui (New York style). Routes: Home, Projects, Documents, Workflows, Schedules, Inbox, Monitor, Settings.
