# Handoff: ainative pivot — work to perform in the `stagent` (product code) repo

**Date:** 2026-04-17
**Author:** Manav Sehgal
**Companion spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-17-ainative-pivot-design.md` in the website repo at `../stagent.github.io/` (soon to be renamed `../ainative-business.github.io/`)
**Target repo:** `manavsehgal/stagent` → to be renamed `manavsehgal/ainative`

---

## Why this handoff exists

The website repo (`manavsehgal/stagent.github.io`) is being pivoted from "Stagent" to "ainative". The product code repo (`manavsehgal/stagent`) needs the matching pivot to land in parallel so the two repos stay in sync. This document hands off the product-repo work to a parallel session running against that repo.

The website repo's spec covers all the website-side changes. It explicitly marks the product-code repo's changes as "Out of scope" because they happen here, in a different working directory. **This handoff is the contract between the two sessions.**

## The decisions already made (do not re-litigate)

These were settled during the website-repo brainstorm. Inherit them; do not re-open them.

1. **Software canonical name: `ainative`** (always lowercase, even at sentence start unless grammar absolutely demands `Ainative`). Same convention as `bun`, `npm`, `pnpm`. Rationale: unifies CLI + product + npm package as one identifier; defensible-by-being-descriptive; aligned with command-line-native aesthetic.
2. **The software's runtime, install flow, and behavior do NOT change.** This is a *narrative* pivot, not a *product* pivot. `npx ainative` does exactly what `npx stagent` does today. Do not refactor.
3. **Full rewrite of all "Stagent" references to "ainative"** — no historical preservation, no dual-name period. Project is 30 days old; no real citation graph to preserve.
4. **Atomic execution.** Land everything in one PR/commit batch on `main`, deploy + npm publish + GitHub repo rename within an hour. Solo author working on `main` per his preference.
5. **Repo rename target: `manavsehgal/ainative`** (not `manavsehgal/ainative-app` or anything else). GitHub auto-redirects old URLs forever.
6. **npm package name: `ainative`** (verified available on registry as of 2026-04-17). Single name, no scope (`@manavsehgal/ainative` was considered and rejected — bare name is cleaner for `npx ainative`).

## Scope of work in the `stagent` repo

### 1. Repo rename

- Rename `manavsehgal/stagent` → `manavsehgal/ainative` via GitHub repo settings.
- After rename, update local clones: `git remote set-url origin git@github.com:manavsehgal/ainative.git`.
- GitHub auto-redirects `https://github.com/manavsehgal/stagent` to the new URL permanently — no action needed for inbound link rot.

### 2. Package rename

- `package.json` → change `"name": "stagent"` to `"name": "ainative"`.
- If there's a `bin` field for the CLI, ensure the binary name is `ainative` (not `stagent`). The `npx ainative` invocation depends on this.
- Bump version to a clean release number (e.g., `0.x.0` → `0.(x+1).0`) reflecting the rename — semver-wise it's a breaking change for anyone already using `stagent` as a dependency, even though the runtime is unchanged.
- `package-lock.json` regenerate after `package.json` edit.

### 3. CLI binary / source rename

- Any string literals, log lines, banners, splash screens, help text, prompt strings, or branding output that say "Stagent" → "ainative".
- Internal module names, class names, type names that include "Stagent" or "stagent" — rename for consistency. (Type `StagentConfig` → `AinativeConfig`, etc.)
- Source filenames that include `stagent` — rename. Use `git mv` to preserve history.
- README.md (if present) — full rewrite reflecting the new framing: "ainative is the companion software for the *AI Native Business* book by Manav Sehgal." Link to https://ainative.business.

### 4. Brand surface

- npm `description` field → reframed as book companion (suggestion: *"Companion software for the AI Native Business book — a local-first agent runtime and builder scaffold for AI-native businesses."*).
- npm `homepage` field → `https://ainative.business`.
- npm `repository` field → updated to new GitHub URL.
- npm `bugs` URL → updated.
- npm `keywords` → keep technical keywords (`agents`, `local-first`, etc.); consider adding `ai-native-business` and `book-companion`.
- License field stays `Apache-2.0`.

### 5. Docs and supporting files

- README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CHANGELOG.md, any `/docs/`, any examples directory — all rewritten using the same 1:1 substitution rule (`Stagent` → `ainative`, lowercase mid-sentence).
- Code comments referencing "Stagent" — rewrite.
- Test names, test descriptions — rewrite where they include the brand.
- Any GitHub Actions workflow files referencing the old repo name or stagent-specific resources — update.

### 6. Asset renames

- Logo files in the repo (favicons, banners) named `stagent-*.png` → `ainative-*.png`. Update README image references. (The website repo handles its own logo assets separately.)

### 7. **REQUIRED — User-facing surface renames the docs already promise**

The website's docs subsite has been rewritten and now documents these renames as fact. **The product code MUST match these or the docs will be wrong on day one of deploy.** This is not optional.

- **Workspace/data directory paths:**
  - `~/.stagent/` → `~/.ainative/`
  - `~/.stagent-wealth` → `~/.ainative-wealth`
  - Any other `~/.stagent*` paths the runtime creates or reads.
- **Environment variables (uppercase):**
  - `STAGENT_DEV_MODE` → `AINATIVE_DEV_MODE`
  - `STAGENT_DATA_DIR` → `AINATIVE_DATA_DIR`
  - `STAGENT_CLOUD_DISABLED` → `AINATIVE_CLOUD_DISABLED`
  - Any other `STAGENT_*` env vars the runtime reads.
- **Filesystem sentinels:**
  - `.git/stagent-dev-mode` → `.git/ainative-dev-mode`
- **Git tag prefix for checkpoints:**
  - `stagent-cp-*` → `ainative-cp-*`
- **HTTP header names** (e.g., for Telegram poll auth or other internal channel sentinels):
  - `x-stagent-internal` → `x-ainative-internal`
  - Any other `x-stagent-*` headers.
- **API enum literal values** (the wire format the API actually returns):
  - In profile-format responses: `"format": "stagent"` → `"format": "ainative"` (and any matching TypeScript type literals).
- **GitHub repo URLs in example/seed content** (e.g., default templates pointing at `acme/stagent-blueprints`, `acme/stagent-profiles`, `acme/stagent-skills`) → rename to `acme/ainative-blueprints` etc., or remove if those example repos don't exist.

**Migration concern:** existing users of `stagent` will have data in `~/.stagent/` and config in `STAGENT_DEV_MODE`. The atomic rename means their data appears to vanish on upgrade. Decide:
- (a) One-shot migration on first launch under the new name (read old paths if new ones are empty, write to new paths going forward, optionally delete old after confirmation).
- (b) Document the manual migration step in the upgrade notes (`mv ~/.stagent ~/.ainative`).
- (c) Accept the loss for pre-alpha — at 30 days old with near-zero installed base, this is genuinely acceptable.

The website docs do NOT mention any migration path because the spec marked migration as out of scope. If you choose (a) or (b), update the website's docs in a follow-up PR after the product code lands.

## Cross-repo coordination

The two pivots have to land within a tight window so visitors don't see a mid-pivot site that links to a non-existent GitHub repo.

**Required ordering:**

1. **In any order (independent):**
   - Land all changes in the website repo on `main` (covered by the website spec).
   - Land all changes in the product code repo on `main` (covered by this handoff).
2. **Then, coordinated within the same hour:**
   - Rename `manavsehgal/stagent.github.io` → `manavsehgal/ainative-business.github.io` (website).
   - Rename `manavsehgal/stagent` → `manavsehgal/ainative` (product code).
   - Update CNAME in the website repo to `ainative.business`; update DNS.
   - Publish the renamed npm package: `npm publish` for `ainative@<new-version>`.
   - Create `manavsehgal/stagent-io-redirect` (covered by website spec) — the meta-refresh shell at the old domain.

**Failure mode to avoid:** if the website rename + deploy lands while the product repo is still named `stagent`, all GitHub links on the new ainative.business site would 404 (until GitHub's auto-redirect catches up — usually instant, but not guaranteed). Mitigate by doing both renames in immediate sequence.

## Out of scope (do not do here)

- Anything in the website repo (`manavsehgal/stagent.github.io`) — the website session owns it.
- Anything in the book content (`src/data/book/`) — the book lives in the website repo.
- Anything in the research papers — they live in the website repo.
- Skills under `.claude/skills/` of the website repo — handled there.
- DNS changes for `stagent.io` and `ainative.business` — performed by the website session and Manav personally.
- The redirect repo (`stagent-io-redirect`) — the website session creates it.
- npm package for the website (`stagent-website` → `ainative-business-website`) — that's a workspace-internal name in the website repo, not published.

## Verification (before commit / publish in the product repo)

1. `grep -ri "stagent" .` in the product repo → expect zero matches outside `.git/`, `node_modules/`, lockfiles, and any deliberate historical mention in `CHANGELOG.md` (acceptable to leave a single `## Renamed from stagent` heading there for provenance).
2. `grep -ri "Stagent" .` → zero matches outside the same exceptions.
3. CLI smoke test: `npm pack && npx ./ainative-<version>.tgz` → verify the binary launches, the help text says "ainative", no "Stagent" appears in any output.
4. `npm publish --dry-run` → verify the package metadata (name, description, repository, homepage) all show ainative branding.
5. Tag the release: `git tag v<new-version>`, `git push --tags`.

## After both repos land

- Verify the website at `https://ainative.business/` shows the new branding, with the GitHub link in the nav resolving to `https://github.com/manavsehgal/ainative` (HTTP 200, not 404).
- Verify `https://stagent.io/<any-path>` redirects to `https://ainative.business/<any-path>` (path-preserving meta-refresh).
- Verify `npm view ainative` shows the published package with the new metadata.
- Notify the few people who have the old `stagent.io` URL or have done `npx stagent` — direct them to the new commands and links.

After the pivot, ainative.business inherits this role; no Maven-side action required from this handoff (Maven cohort copy lives outside both repos).
