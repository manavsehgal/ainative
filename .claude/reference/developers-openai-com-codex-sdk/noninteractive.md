# Non-interactive mode

Non-interactive mode lets you run Codex from scripts (for example, continuous integration (CI) jobs) without opening the interactive TUI.
You invoke it with `codex exec`.

For flag-level details, see [`codex exec`](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/reference#codex-exec).

## When to use `codex exec`

Use `codex exec` when you want Codex to:

- Run as part of a pipeline (CI, pre-merge checks, scheduled jobs).
- Produce output you can pipe into other tools (for example, to generate release notes or summaries).
- Run with explicit, pre-set sandbox and approval settings.

## Basic usage

Pass a task prompt as a single argument:

```bash
codex exec "summarize the repository structure and list the top 5 risky areas"
```

While `codex exec` runs, Codex streams progress to `stderr` and prints only the final agent message to `stdout`. This makes it straightforward to redirect or pipe the final result:

```bash
codex exec "generate release notes for the last 10 commits" | tee release-notes.md
```

Use `--ephemeral` when you don't want to persist session rollout files to disk:

```bash
codex exec --ephemeral "triage this repository and suggest next steps"
```

## Permissions and safety

By default, `codex exec` runs in a read-only sandbox. In automation, set the least permissions needed for the workflow:

- Allow edits: `codex exec --full-auto "<task>"`
- Allow broader access: `codex exec --sandbox danger-full-access "<task>"`

Use `danger-full-access` only in a controlled environment (for example, an isolated CI runner or container).

If you configure an enabled MCP server with `required = true` and it fails to initialize, `codex exec` exits with an error instead of continuing without that server.

## Make output machine-readable

To consume Codex output in scripts, use JSON Lines output:

```bash
codex exec --json "summarize the repo structure" | jq
```

When you enable `--json`, `stdout` becomes a JSON Lines (JSONL) stream so you can capture every event Codex emits while it's running. Event types include `thread.started`, `turn.started`, `turn.completed`, `turn.failed`, `item.*`, and `error`.

Item types include agent messages, reasoning, command executions, file changes, MCP tool calls, web searches, and plan updates.

Sample JSON stream (each line is a JSON object):

```jsonl
{"type":"thread.started","thread_id":"0199a213-81c0-7800-8aa1-bbab2a035a53"}
{"type":"turn.started"}
{"type":"item.started","item":{"id":"item_1","type":"command_execution","command":"bash -lc ls","status":"in_progress"}}
{"type":"item.completed","item":{"id":"item_3","type":"agent_message","text":"Repo contains docs, sdk, and examples directories."}}
{"type":"turn.completed","usage":{"input_tokens":24763,"cached_input_tokens":24448,"output_tokens":122}}
```

If you only need the final message, write it to a file with `-o <path>`/`--output-last-message <path>`. This writes the final message to the file and still prints it to `stdout` (see [`codex exec`](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/reference#codex-exec) for details).

## Create structured outputs with a schema

If you need structured data for downstream steps, use `--output-schema` to request a final response that conforms to a JSON Schema.
This is useful for automated workflows that need stable fields (for example, job summaries, risk reports, or release metadata).

`schema.json`

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "project_name": { "type": "string" },
    "programming_languages": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": { "type": "string" }
    }
  },
  "required": ["project_name", "programming_languages"],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

Run Codex with the schema and write the final JSON response to disk:

```bash
codex exec "Extract project metadata" \
  --output-schema ./schema.json \
  -o ./project-metadata.json
```

Example final output (stdout):

```json
{
  "project_name": "Codex CLI",
  "programming_languages": ["Rust", "TypeScript", "Shell"]
}
```

## Authenticate in CI

`codex exec` reuses saved CLI authentication by default. In CI, it's common to provide credentials explicitly:

### Use API key auth (recommended)

- Set `CODEX_API_KEY` as a secret environment variable for the job.
- Keep prompts and tool output in mind: they can include sensitive code or data.

To use a different API key for a single run, set `CODEX_API_KEY` inline:

```bash
CODEX_API_KEY=<api-key> codex exec --json "triage open bug reports"
```

`CODEX_API_KEY` is only supported in `codex exec`.

<ToggleSection title="Use ChatGPT-managed auth in CI/CD (advanced)">
Read this if you need to run CI/CD jobs with a Codex user account instead of an
API key, such as enterprise teams using ChatGPT-managed Codex access on trusted
runners or users who need ChatGPT/Codex rate limits instead of API key usage.

API keys are the right default for automation because they are simpler to
provision and rotate. Use this path only if you specifically need to run as
your Codex account.

Treat `~/.codex/auth.json` like a password: it contains access tokens. Don't
commit it, paste it into tickets, or share it in chat.

Do not use this workflow for public or open-source repositories. If `codex login`
is not an option on the runner, seed `auth.json` through secure storage, run
Codex on the runner so Codex refreshes it in place, and persist the updated file
between runs.

See [Maintain Codex account auth in CI/CD (advanced)](https://developers.openai.com/codex/auth/ci-cd-auth).

## Resume a non-interactive session

If you need to continue a previous run (for example, a two-stage pipeline), use the `resume` subcommand:

```bash
codex exec "review the change for race conditions"
codex exec resume --last "fix the race conditions you found"
```

You can also target a specific session ID with `codex exec resume <SESSION_ID>`.

## Git repository required

Codex requires commands to run inside a Git repository to prevent destructive changes. Override this check with `codex exec --skip-git-repo-check` if you're sure the environment is safe.

## Common automation patterns

### Example: Autofix CI failures in GitHub Actions

You can use `codex exec` to automatically propose fixes when a CI workflow fails. The typical pattern is:

1. Trigger a follow-up workflow when your main CI workflow completes with an error.
2. Check out the failing commit SHA.
3. Install dependencies and run Codex with a narrow prompt and minimal permissions.
4. Re-run the test command.
5. Open a pull request with the resulting patch.

#### Minimal workflow using the Codex CLI

The example below shows the core steps. Adjust the install and test commands to match your stack.

```yaml
name: Codex auto-fix on CI failure

on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ["CI"]
    types: [completed]

permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  auto-fix:
    if: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.conclusion == 'failure' }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
      FAILED_HEAD_SHA: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.head_sha }}
      FAILED_HEAD_BRANCH: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.head_branch }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          ref: ${{ env.FAILED_HEAD_SHA }}
          fetch-depth: 0

      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "20"

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          if [ -f package-lock.json ]; then npm ci; else npm i; fi

      - name: Install Codex
        run: npm i -g @openai/codex

      - name: Authenticate Codex
        run: codex login --api-key "$OPENAI_API_KEY"

      - name: Run Codex
        run: |
          codex exec --full-auto --sandbox workspace-write \
            "Read the repository, run the test suite, identify the minimal change needed to make all tests pass, implement only that change, and stop. Do not refactor unrelated files."

      - name: Verify tests
        run: npm test --silent

      - name: Create pull request
        if: success()
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v6
        with:
          branch: codex/auto-fix-${{ github.event.workflow_run.run_id }}
          base: ${{ env.FAILED_HEAD_BRANCH }}
          title: "Auto-fix failing CI via Codex"
```

#### Alternative: Use the Codex GitHub Action

If you want to avoid installing the CLI yourself, you can run `codex exec` through the [Codex GitHub Action](https://developers.openai.com/codex/github-action) and pass the prompt as an input.
